    "The objective of the simulation is to provide hands-on application-oriented understanding of the following concepts,\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Location\n",
    "Measures of Variability\n",
    "With the help of video tutorials and reading materials, you will get a good understanding on the above concepts of  'Measures of Location' which summarizes values (mean, median, mode, etc.) and 'Measures of Variability' that describes spread of the data (standard deviation, variance, range, IQR etc.). In this section, we will also focus on applying the knowledge on a real business data and try to interpret results and call out business insights.\n",

    "Jason Smith is a technology hedge fund manager. The only two stocks that he tracks in his portfolio are \n",
    "\n",
    "Apple (AAPL)\n",
    "Microsoft (MSFT)\n",
    "As a hedge fund manager, he has the need to understand how the stocks in his portfolio are performing. For this he likes to look for an appropriate statistical tool that would provide him high level insight into stock prices to plan his purchase and redemption strategy.\n",

    "Daily log return is a convenient way to calculate return from investment in stocks. It is calculated by taking natural log of today's stock price divided by yesterday's stock price.\n",

    "Mean\n",
    "Inter-Quartile Range\n",
    "Standard Deviation\n",
    "A regular tracking of these measures will help him to devise further investment strategies for risk management (like value at Risk, VaR) or hedging purposes."

    "The objective of the data case is to provide hands-on experience in understanding and applying Correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation is useful to find out the relationship between variables and understand the strength of the relationship. Correlation coefficient is the value which tells us about type and strength of relationship. We will be studying in detail one of such commonly used metric i.e. Pearson Correlation coefficient through this business case. This coefficient measures linear relationship between two variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "Jason Smith is a technology hedge fund manager. The only two stocks that he tracks in his portfolio are \n",
    "\n",
    "Apple (AAPL)\n",
    "Microsoft (MSFT)\n",
    "To keep a track of his portfolio, we have seen he calculates descriptive measures like \n",
    "\n",
    "Mean\n",
    "Standard Deviation\n",
    "Range of both these stock prices \n",
    "Daily Log Return\n",
    "Along with daily log return of these two stocks (AAPL and MSFT), he also tracks the S&P Index, measured by the return of SPX (The S&P 500 measures the value of stocks of 500 largest corporations by market capitalization listed on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Composite). This data is also provided along with the log return values of SPX.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jason wants to understand whether the daily log return of stocks has any relationship with the S&P index. The relationship can be better understood by computing a Pearson Correlation coefficient between daily log return of the two stocks (AAPL and MSFT) with the S&P Index measured by the return of SPX .\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring this relationship will be of some use to Jason for planning his hedging strategies."

    "Learning Goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "This data case will help you understand the different metrics considered for testing normality of the data. The normal distribution is one of the most important probability distribution in statistics, with wide ranging applications in advanced techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "Majority of continuous data follows normal distribution, so it becomes important to understand how to check whether a given data follows normal distribution or not. To test the normality of data, we will focus on two different approaches in this data case, as follows,\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness - Skewness measures symmetry of a distribution. It is equal to 0 for a normal distribution. Any value other than 0 will represent non-normality. Skewness with a negative value indicate that the data is skewed to the left. Positive values for skewness indicate that the data are skewed right.\n",
    "Kurtosis - Kurtosis measures flatness of the probability distribution of real valued random variable. It measures the amount of probability in the tails. The value is often compared to the kurtosis of the normal distribution, which is equal to 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen in the previous module, Jason Smith is a technology hedge fund manager. By using the univariate and bivariate staistics like, summary statistics and correlation, he is able to track the performance of the two stocks in his portfolio i.e Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n",
    "\n",
    "To further evaluate these stocks, he wants to understand underlying distribution of the performance of his stocks. For this he wants to test if the daily log return of the two premium stocks of his portfolio Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) is normal or not."
